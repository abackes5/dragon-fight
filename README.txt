Hello and welcome to this lil game I made

The general instructions: 
  1. Pull both python files
  2. Run fight_main.py
  3. That's it. Let me know how you feel about the game balance and if you run into any bugs
  
More detailed instructions:
  1. Click the green button that says Code, in the dropdown select Download ZIP
        Note that the files will not stay updated, but this is definitely the easiest way to to do it. I'll let you know if I make major changes
  2. Unzip the files to a folder of your choosing.
  3a. If you have Spyder: open Spyder, open fight_main.py, click Run or press F5
  3b. If you do not have Spyder, and assuming you have Windows and Python 3:
        1. Copy the file path to the folder where you unzipped the files
        2. Open a Command Prompt window
        3. Enter: cd <your file path>
            For example, for me it will look like: 
            cd S:\Practice projects\Python
            If you need to change drives (for example, if your file path starts with S: and you're starting at C:\Users), enter S: and that's it (or whatever the drive is called)
        4. Enter: python3 fight_main.py
    4. Play the game! Again, let me know about balance and bugs
